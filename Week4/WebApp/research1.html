            	<h3>Week 1: Industry Research and Project Intent</h3>
            	<p>What types of native features (on Android and iOS devices) would you be able to implement with the use of HTML/CSS/JS only?</p>
 
<p>While I was reviewing the reading material I noticed a few native features I would be able to implement with the use of HTML/CSS/JS is geolocation and JSON parsing. JSON parsing I knew could be done through JS, but geolocation is something I had know idea could be done through simple HTML/CSS/JS. A lot of other features I see listed for HTML/CSS are no brainers and are required with the design of any app in my opinion.</P>
 
<p>What types of features do you think will pair well together in an app?</p>
 
<p>Types of features that I think work well together in an app are geolocation and compass, Media and storage, contacts and camera to name a few.</p>
 
<p>Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.</p>
 
<p>The design of my app will consist of fixed positioning, inline blocks, a background image, text shadow and form validation. As far as the functionality of the app, I will like to incorporate social integration, geolocation, maps, VoiceOver and calendar. I feel these implementations will make my app much stronger and interactive.</p>
 
<p>Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</p>
 
<p>Past lessons that I've learned regarding workflow as related to research design and development was to look at other inspiration to pull in for your for your application. I have learned by doing this you get ideas that you may have not originally thought of. I have also learned that time management is very important when designing and developing an application. Finally, I've learned that flowcharts are a plus when developing your app although, I did not like it at first.</p>
