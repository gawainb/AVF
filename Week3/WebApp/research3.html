            	<h3>Week 3: Market Research</h3>
            	<p>What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.?</p>

<p>The most popular categories are games; news; maps; social networking and music.</p>

<p>What are the 'top selling' app categories in Japan?</p>

<p>The most popular categories in Japan are Games, Books, and utilities.</p>

<p>What are the 'top selling' app categories in Great Britain?</p>

<p>The most popular selling categories in Great Britain is games.</p>

<p>Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</p>

<p>Based on my three answers above it makes me think how much more education seems to be important in Japan. Looking at America it seems that pop culture is more important and in Great Britain they just live to have fun by playing video games.</p>

<p>What percentage of Android users have the latest/greatest OS in the U.S? in Japan? in Great Britain? How might these differences impact development?</p>

<p>I can not find a chart showing the percentages of these by each country but I did find an overall chart that shows the Gingerbread OS the most popular currently. There has been a small growth for Jelly bean to 1.8% and a larger growth for ICS of about 3-4%. Due to the slow rollouts of android OS and various phones that support these OS's it limits the development on these devices. and you always have to check compatibility with Android.</p>

<p>What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?</p>

<p>The average costs fluctuate based on the provider you choose and type of phone you use. I notice more users are eligible for unlimited data with an Android over a iPhone. This gives developers to create an app that is quick and has a smaller load and download time.</p>

<p>And, finally, what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</p>

<p>My first choice based on what I have read would be a game. They do well in all three countries. My second choice would be a utility app. The platform I think that is best is Android because it is surpassing iPhone more and more in each country. Also, more people would be inclined to buy in the android market due to the increased bandwidth.</p>
