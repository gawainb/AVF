            	<h3>Week 2: Accessability</h3>
            	<p>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible? (Remember, you can use the Section tag with jQuery, for instance?</p>
 
<p>From reading the resources provided there are a number of ways I can I can make my Demo app more accessible. One way is to incorporate the Polyfill Captioner in my videos so that the deaf can read what is going on in my videos. Another way is to incorporate  visual chapters. This will make navigation much easier and accessible.</P>
 
<p>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</p>
 
<p>Based on what I have discovered about frustrations with screen readers would be to differentiate ads in websites. Perhaps if you could use the arrow keys to select the areas through out the website and it read you what is selected  would probably great.In order of this to be effective the website must be constructed simple and not overly full of content so that it would not confuse them.</p>
 
<p>
Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</p>
 
<p>Blackberry and iPhones are two heavily supported devices for accessibly. One feature on the iPhone is voiceover. One feature on the Blackberry is predictive text.</p>
 
<p>Mobile Apps: Please list two apps (either Android or iOS, or both) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</p>
 
<p>One app on Android for accessibility is Mobile accessibility which is of the blind. Siri is another application that is great for accessibility. Especially now that it can open apps and be a personal assistant.</p>
